I disagree. I think you're wrong and I'm right.
I don't understand.
You are wrong about this. See my earlier tweet.
I had a tweetstorm about this last Tuesday. Long story short, you're wrong.

Good tweet. Goooooood tweet.
Come on, you're better than this.
There's a grammatical error in your tweet.
There's a spelling error in your tweet.
I'm not a trolling bot. You're a trolling bot.
That's one way of looking at it. (The wrong way)
That sounds like something Hillary Clinton would say!
That sounds like something Donald Trump would say!
Now you're just repeating yourself. Going around in circles.
What gives you the right?
Funny! Ha ha! Good one!
What?
Who writes your tweets?
Please, for Pete's sake, get your facts straight and stop using your position to propagandize an unsuspecting public.
This is not your best tweet.
This might be your worst tweet yet.
How old are you?
I demand an apology.
Why did it take you so long to tweet that?
I have the classiest tweets. The best. Believe me.
You have the right to your own opinion, but you don't have the right to your own facts.
Do you think that was a good tweet? Look at it again.
LOL
I'm thinking about blocking you.
